<!-- **Research:** My goal is to build powerful AI models capable of understanding, generating and reasoning with high-dimensional data across diverse modalities. I am currently focused on developing transferable techniques to improve generative models, including their training methodologies, architecture design, alignment, robustness, evaluation techniques and inference efficiency. I am also interested in generative modeling as a tool for scientific discovery. I invented many foundational concepts and techniques in (score-based) diffusion models, for which you can find more in a [blog post](/blog/2021/score/) and a [quanta magazine article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-physics-principle-that-inspired-modern-ai-art-20230105/).

**Previously:** I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), advised by [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon). I was a research intern at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/), Uber ATG, and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml), [Raquel Urtasun](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/), and [Richard Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php). -->


**Biograph:** Being mentored by [Professor Yan Yang](https://faculty.swjtu.edu.cn/yangyan1/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Assistant Researcher Yongquan Jiang](https://faculty.swjtu.edu.cn/jiangyongquan/zh_CN/index.htm), I am currently pursuing my <u>Master's degree</u> in "Computer Science and Technology" at the [School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence](https://scai.swjtu.edu.cn/index.html), [Southwest Jiaotong University (SWJTU)](https://www.swjtu.edu.cn/). Prior to this, I earned my <u>Bachelor of Science degree</u> from the [School of Science](https://www.swpu.edu.cn/lxy/) at [Southwest Petroleum University (SWPU)](https://www.swpu.edu.cn/), majoring in "Electronic Information Science and Technology".

**Research Topics:** I am primarily engaged in the exploration of **AI for Science**, with a particular concentration on **Molecular Machine Learning**. In addition to this, I possess a substantial interest in the study and application of **Deep Generative Algorithms**.
